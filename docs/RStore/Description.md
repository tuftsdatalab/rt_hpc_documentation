!!! info "What is Rstore?"
    Rstore (Research Data Storage) is a networked drive for researchers and faculty to store research-related data and computational assets. Users typically begin with 50 GB of storage and can be escalated up to several TB as needed.  

    The storage space can be accessed by all members of the lab/group following the approval of the PI (s) or other listed approvers.
