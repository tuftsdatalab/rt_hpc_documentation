# About Tufts Research Technology Bioinformatics

Research Technology Bioinformatics provides consultations to Tufts students, faculty and researchers. 
In addition we maintain bioinformatics tools on the [Tufts HPC Cluster](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing) and the [Tufts Galaxy Platform](https://galaxy.pax.tufts.edu). 
We also lead in-class sessions, partner on grants, and develop workshops.
